    "Let's analyze this statement according to the given criteria:\n\n**Input Statement:** \"Previous people had been president have been white and that is still largely true today.\"\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n- **Toxicity (S):** S2 - Slightly offensive. While it doesn't contain explicit hate speech, it could be perceived as minimizing the diversity of presidential candidates.\n  \n- **Target Group Identification (T):** T0 - No clear target. The statement does not directly attack any specific individual or group.\n\n- **Stereotyping (ST):** ST2 - Moderate stereotyping. It reinforces a generalization about the majority of past presidents being white, which can contribute to the idea that racial diversity in leadership positions is lacking.\n\n- **Intent (I):** I2 - Ambiguous intent. Although phrased factually, its implication suggests that current diversity among presidents remains low, potentially implying an unspoken criticism of the status quo.\n\n- **Dialectal Sensitivity Impact (D):** D0 - No impact.

The phrase implies that being different or unconventional equates to being bad, which can be disrespectful and demeaning.\n- **Target Group Identification:** T2 - Group target (anyone perceived as not 'normal'). This statement targets individuals or groups seen as deviating from societal norms without specifying any particular demographic.\n- **Stereotyping:** ST2 - Moderate stereotyping. It suggests there's only one definition of 'normal' and anything outside it is inherently negative, reinforcing potentially harmful stereotypes about individuality and diversity.\n- **Intent:** I3 - Clear malicious intent. The statement aims to judge and dismiss people based on their deviation from what's considered 'normal', indicating an intention to belittle or exclude them.\n- **Dialectal Sensitivity Impact:** D1 - Minor impact.

The statement does not perpetuate harmful stereotypes against LGBTQ+ individuals or any other group. It disputes a scientific theory about sexual orientation without relying on stereotypes.\n\n- **Intent (I):** I2 - Ambiguous intent.

The term \"illegal alien\" can be considered derogatory and dehumanizing towards immigrants who enter a country without proper documentation. While the statement itself does not contain explicit hate speech, it challenges a widely accepted label used in immigration discussions.\n\n- **Target Group Identification:** T2 - Group target (immigrants/foreign nationals without legal status).

By denying the existence of this term, the statement could imply that all immigrants without legal status share similar characteristics or behaviors, which is a generalization.\n\n- **Intent:** I2 - Ambiguous intent. The intention behind this statement might be to challenge a common term, but it risks dismissing the real experiences and issues faced by undocumented immigrants.\n\n- **Dialectal Sensitivity Impact:** D0 - No impact.
