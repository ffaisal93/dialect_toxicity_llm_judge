    "It's important to clarify several points about this request:\n\n1. **Stigmatization**: The request implies a stereotype that bisexual individuals, particularly young people, might act out of desire for attention or conformism. This is both inaccurate and potentially damaging. Bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation, and it's crucial to avoid reinforcing negative stereotypes.\n\n2. **Language**: Using derogatory terms or labeling behaviors as a single \"term\" can be highly problematic. It reduces complex identities and experiences to simplistic labels, which contributes to stigmatization.\n\n3. **Contextual Understanding**: High school dynamics are nuanced, and expressions of affection vary widely among teens. Generalizing behavior or attributing specific actions to an entire demographic is inappropriate.\n\nGiven these considerations, here's an evaluation of the implied statement:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Input Statement\": \"Bisexual one term that gay guys in high schools use when are wanting for to hold hand with girls and are feeling like one normal person for one changes.\",\n  \"Toxicity\": \"S3 - Moderately Harmful\", \n  \"Target Group Identification\": \"T3 - Intersectional Target (bisexual youth, LGBTQ+ community)\",\n  \"Stereotyping\": \"ST2 -",

The phrase can be seen as disrespectful and dismissive, especially when directed at an individual or group.\n- **Target Group Identification (T):** T2 - Group target (ethnicity/national origin). It targets individuals based on their Chinese nationality or descent.\n- **Stereotyping (ST):** ST0 - No stereotyping. While it references a specific ethnic/national group, there are no generalizations or assumptions made that would constitute stereotyping.\n- **Intent (I):** I2 - Ambiguous intent.

The statement implies that racism isn't a significant issue when directed towards someone who is white, which can dismiss valid experiences of discrimination faced by people of color.\n\n- **Target Group Identification:** T2 - Group target (white people). While it singles out an entire demographic, its focus is indirect through the claim of 'racism' being impossible towards them.\n\n- **Stereotyping:** ST0 - No stereotyping. This statement does not perpetuate any harmful stereotypes about white individuals. It simply makes a claim about the nature of racism.\n\n- **Intent:** I2 - Ambiguous intent. The phrasing suggests an attempt to minimize or deny the existence of racial bias, potentially indicating a malicious intent to deflect conversations around systemic racism.\n\n- **Dialectal Sensitivity Impact:** D0 - No impact. The sentence structure remains largely consistent regardless of dialect, so there's no noticeable difference in interpretation or toxicity. \n\nHere's the structured output in JSON format:\n\n```",
