The statement focuses on a broad demographic (presidents), not any specific individual or group.\n\n3. **Stereotyping (ST):** ST0 - No stereotyping. This statement makes an observation about skin color and political office holding without attributing any characteristics or behaviors to people of a particular racial group. It simply states a fact.\n\n4. **Intent (I):** I1 - No malicious intent.
