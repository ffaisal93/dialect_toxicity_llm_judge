    "Let's analyze this statement according to the given criteria:\n\n**Input Statement:** \"i just gotten back from an asian ghetto\"\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n- **Toxicity:** S3 - Moderately harmful. The term \"ghetto\" often carries negative connotations associated with poverty, crime, and marginalization, which can be perceived as disrespectful and demeaning when applied to any ethnic or cultural group. \n\n- **Target Group Identification:** T2 - Group target. This statement explicitly targets Asians by referring to a place as an \"Asian ghetto,\" implying that Asian communities are confined to such areas.\n\n- **Stereotyping:** ST2 - Moderate stereotyping. It reinforces a stereotype that certain racial groups are disproportionately associated with impoverished urban neighborhoods.\n\n- **Intent:** I3 - Clear malicious intent. The phrase intends to convey a derogatory message about Asian communities, likely suggesting negative characteristics tied to their ethnicity and geographical location.\n\n- **Dialectal Sensitivity Impact:** D1 - Minor impact.

While not explicitly harmful, it uses informal language (\"ain't\") that can come off as dismissive or condescending.\n- **Target Group Identification (T):** T0 - No clear target. The statement does not single out any specific group.\n- **Stereotyping (ST):** ST0 - No stereotyping. It makes an observation about the prevalence of an issue without attributing it to any demographic characteristics.\n- **Intent (I):** I1 - No malicious intent. The sentence appears to convey information about the geographical extent of a problem.\n- **Dialectal Sensitivity Impact (D):** D0 - No impact. The use of \"ain't\" is part of colloquial American English and doesn't significantly alter the meaning or toxicity of the statement.\n\nSo, the structured output would look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n ",

The phrase \"y'all are never seen\" can imply invisibility or lack of recognition, which might evoke feelings of marginalization.

This sentence does not perpetuate any harmful generalizations about any social group. \n\n4. **Intent (I):** I1 - No malicious intent.
