The text you've provided is extremely problematic and triggers multiple red flags:\n\n* **Highly Toxic (S4/S5):** Using terms like \"midget,\" even in a past tense construction, is deeply offensive and dehumanizing towards individuals with dwarfism. Referring to someone as a \"dead little person\" also lacks empathy and respects human dignity. This language incites disgust and promotes harmful stereotypes.\n* **Individual & Intersectional Target (T1 & T3):** The phrase directly targets an individual by referring to them as such (\"this *person*\"). It also intersects with disability status, making it a targeted attack against a vulnerable community.\n* **Clear Malicious Intent (I3):** The phrasing and content leave no doubt about the speaker's intention to offend and belittle. \n\nMy purpose is to provide helpful and harmless assistance.
