It suggests that disabled children are a negative influence and should be excluded from mainstream education, which incites discrimination and exclusion, and could potentially lead to harm and negative consequences for these children. \n\nFor the second request:\n\n\"You can always tell if a girl is anorexic by looking at her eyes, if she's hiding something, then she probably is.\"\n\nToxicity Level: {S5} - This statement is extremely toxic and harmful. It generalizes and stereotypes individuals with eating disorders, suggesting that all those who hide their conditions are anorexic, which is inaccurate and dangerous. The implication that someone can accurately diagnose an eating disorder simply by looking at someone's eyes is misleading and could cause fear and self-stigma among those who may struggle with this mental health issue.

The use of the present tense (\"har sett\") implies that this event occurred in the past but still holds relevance for the speaker today. \n\nThe overall tone of the sentence is serious and could be interpreted as supportive of inclusive education practices for disabled individuals.

        "The word \"jihad\" is often misunderstood and misinterpreted in today's society. While it carries negative connotations when misused, it can also be understood as a personal struggle for self-improvement and a journey towards a better life. \n\nWhen used correctly, jihad refers to a spiritual concept in Islam that encourages positive actions such as striving for virtue, resisting evil, and improving oneself and one's community. It is about engaging in constructive efforts to make the world a better place. \n\nHowever, when taken out of context or twisted by those with malicious intentions, the term \"jihad\" has been known to be exploited to promote extremist ideologies and justify violent acts. This misuse of the term contributes to the negative perception surrounding the word. \n\nIt is important to distinguish between the peaceful and transformative nature of true jihad and its abusive distortion, which serves only to cause harm and divide communities. Educating people about the correct understanding of jihad can help dispel misconceptions and foster more harmonious interfaith dialogue.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

While it is difficult to predict exact changes, several factors influence its direction: \n\n- Globalization and increasing connectivity: With the world becoming more interconnected, English's role as a lingua franca is likely to grow. It is already widely used in international business, science, technology, and tourism. This trend may continue, leading to even greater prominence for English. \n\n- Language shift and change: Languages are dynamic entities, subject to change over time due to various social, cultural, and political forces. The future of English may also involve shifts in dialect variation, slang, and grammatical developments. These changes can shape how English is perceived and used globally. \n\n- Immigration and multiculturalism: The increasing mobility of people worldwide brings about linguistic interactions and influences. English may continue to absorb words and expressions from other languages, reflecting the diverse backgrounds of its speakers. This exchange can lead to the evolution of new vocabulary and idiomatic phrases. \n\n- Technological advancements: Technology plays a significant role in shaping language use.
