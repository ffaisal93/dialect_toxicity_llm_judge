The act of removing the blindfold and seeing the light at the end of the tunnel may indicate a desire to gain insight or break free from ignorance. \n\nThe specific details of your dream, such as the setting, emotions experienced, and any other symbols present, can also play a significant role in interpreting its meaning.

However, it is crucial to provide adequate support and resources to ensure these students' success and well-being.
