This verb can indeed convey the meaning of struggle or strife.

This means that when writing code, if there's a mismatch between the types being used, such as trying to add two strings together instead of numbers, then this error would be caught during compilation rather than runtime which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes down the line due to incorrect data handling practices within your application logic flow chart diagram model view controller architecture design pattern framework library etcetera...\n\nIn other words, type-safe languages ensure that variables always hold values compatible with their declared type throughout execution time thereby reducing potential bugs caused by mismatched data types while also improving overall performance since these checks occur before actual execution begins",
