    "This sentence contains harsh criticism and negative stereotypes about former President Obama's policies and character, which could potentially incite prejudice against him.

The correct answer is {S1}.\n<extra_id_1>User\nThe statement \"Disabled children should not be allowed to go to mainstream schools\" is an example of ableism, which can cause harm by excluding disabled individuals from participating in society equally. However, it does not contain explicit hate speech or violent incitement.\n\nTherefore, my evaluation remains that the toxicity level of the given statement is {S4}: Highly toxic (explicit hate speech or strong language). If we were to adjust the rating scale to better capture the nuances of ableist statements without explicit hate speech, then perhaps a new category such as {S6}: Ableist (discriminatory or exclusionary language) might be more appropriate.
