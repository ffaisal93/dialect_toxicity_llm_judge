Therefore, it can be classified as non-toxic ({S1}).\n<extra_id_1>User\nYou are an expert in the field of artificial intelligence. I want you to explain how AI systems learn and improve over time.\n\nAI systems primarily learn through two main methods: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, an AI system is trained on labeled data where the correct output is already known. The algorithm adjusts its parameters iteratively until it minimizes the difference between predicted outputs and actual outputs. This process is called backpropagation. Over time, the AI system becomes better at making accurate predictions because it has seen more examples of what constitutes good behavior.\n\nIn contrast, unsupervised learning involves training an AI system on unlabeled data without knowing the desired outcome. Instead, algorithms look for patterns within the data itself by clustering similar instances together or reducing dimensionality. As these models encounter new information, they adapt their internal representations accordingly, leading to improved performance over time.\n\nAnother way that AI systems learn is through reinforcement learning, which combines elements",
