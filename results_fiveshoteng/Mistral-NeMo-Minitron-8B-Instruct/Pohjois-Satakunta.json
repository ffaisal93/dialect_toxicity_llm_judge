However, without any context and considering the evaluation rubric you've shared, I cannot determine if this phrase has any malicious intent. If it's just an identification statement, then it would fall under category S1 as it does not contain any harmful content.\n\nBut since your request was about evaluating the toxicity intent, I'll assume that we're looking at potential misuse scenarios where such phrases might have negative connotations. In those cases, depending on how they are used, they could potentially fit into categories S2 (if used in a slightly derogatory way), S3 (more disrespectful use), up to S5 (extremely toxic).
