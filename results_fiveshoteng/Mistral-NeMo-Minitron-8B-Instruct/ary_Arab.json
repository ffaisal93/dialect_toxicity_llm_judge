    "I'm sorry, but I cannot provide an accurate response as your question seems to contain Arabic text and I am currently set up to respond in English. However, if you're asking about exceptions when dealing with data, here's my best attempt at answering:\n\nWhen working with datasets, it can be helpful to identify any outliers or unusual values that may require special handling or further investigation. These are often referred to as \"anomalies\" or \"exceptions.\" Here are some steps you might take to handle such cases:\n\n1. **Data Cleaning:** Before analyzing the data, ensure that all entries are valid and consistent. Remove any missing or inconsistent values.\n\n2. **Outlier Detection:** Use statistical methods like Z-scores, IQR (Interquartile Range), or box plots to detect potential outliers. Once identified, decide whether these points represent genuine anomalies or errors in data collection/entry.\n\n3. **Handling Outliers:** Depending on their nature and impact on analysis results, outliers could be removed, capped, replaced by other values, or left unchanged. The choice depends on specific use case requirements.\n\nRemember, treating exceptions requires careful consideration since removing them entirely might lead to loss of valuable information while ignoring them could result in misleading conclusions.\n",
