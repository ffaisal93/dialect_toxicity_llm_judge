Neural networks have been used successfully for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analysis.\n\nDeep Learning models are a subset of neural networks that contain multiple hidden layers between input and output layers. These additional layers allow the model to learn increasingly complex representations of the data being processed, leading to improved performance compared to traditional shallow neural networks.",
