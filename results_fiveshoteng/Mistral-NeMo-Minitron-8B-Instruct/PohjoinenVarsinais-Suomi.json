However, there is a key distinction between them.\n\nA computer virus is specifically designed to spread itself across different files and systems without user consent. It often attaches itself to legitimate programs and replicates when those programs run. Viruses can perform various actions such as deleting data, stealing sensitive information, or even taking control of infected machines remotely.\n\nOn the other hand, malware refers to any type of malicious code or program intended to gain unauthorized access or cause harm to a system. This category includes worms, trojans, spyware, adware, ransomware, and more. While some forms of malware do replicate themselves automatically, others",
