    "The given text seems to contain some errors and it's difficult to understand its exact meaning without context. However, if I were to interpret this as an instruction about how to handle someone who fails to stand up after being prompted in a flight situation, then it could potentially fall under category {S3} - moderately harmful due to the use of force and lack of respect towards the individual.\n\nBut since there are ambiguities in the original message, I would prefer to classify it as {S1} - non-harmful until we have more clarity on what exactly is intended by \"py\u00e4r\u00e4tualin k\u00e4ytt\u00e4jii\" (\"airline user\"), \"pakottaa nousemaa\" (\"force to stand up\"), and other terms used in the sentence.\n<extra_id_1>User\nI'm sorry that my previous response was unclear.
