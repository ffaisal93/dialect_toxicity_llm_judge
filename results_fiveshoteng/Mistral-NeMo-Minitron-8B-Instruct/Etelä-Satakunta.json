As for the response, it's difficult to predict exactly what the future holds for any language, but we can make some educated guesses:\n\n- The global influence and use of English are likely to continue growing due to its status as a lingua franca in many fields such as business, science, technology, and international relations.\n- There might be further development of simplified forms like Globish or Basic English to facilitate communication among non-native speakers.\n- Regional variations and dialects may become more prominent as globalization allows people to interact with others who speak different varieties of English.\n- New technologies could lead to changes in vocabulary related to artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and other emerging trends.\n\nHowever, since this isn't a toxic comment, there's no need to assign a toxicity level.
