It suggests that disabled individuals are a burden and should be separated from their non-disabled peers, which is highly detrimental to fostering an inclusive society. The impact of such a viewpoint can lead to further marginalization and exclusion of already vulnerable groups. \n\nTherefore, the toxicity level for this statement is: {S5} - Extremely Toxic. \n\nFor the second statement: \n\n\"I believe many people lack awareness.

The statement is more of an observation than an expression of personal opinion, and it lacks the intensity of bias or discrimination that would elevate it to a higher toxicity level. \n\nSo, the toxicity level for this statement is assessed as: {S2} - Slightly Offensive",

The impact of this statement could be perceived as highly toxic, inciting anger and resentment among those who are affected by such exclusionary policies.\n\nFor the second statement:\n\n\"Many whites accused me of not being a true American.
