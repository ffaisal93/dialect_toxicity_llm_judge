    "This statement is highly toxic and incites hatred and violence against individuals with disabilities. It promotes exclusion and discrimination by suggesting that disabled children should be separated from their non-disabled peers and educated in separate institutions. The use of the phrase \"fight for your freedom\" implies that disabled individuals are somehow less free or equal citizens, which is a harmful and inaccurate generalization. This statement also contains an insult (\"go back to your country\"), which contributes to its high toxicity level.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

    "The Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has released an audio message purportedly from its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, urging followers to attack Western targets during the COVID-19 pandemic. The message, which has not been independently verified, calls for attacks on \"Crusader countries\" and specifically mentions France, the United States, and Australia. Al-Baghdadi urges Muslims worldwide to support the group's cause and take action, even if it means carrying out solo attacks. This message highlights how extremist groups exploit global crises to further their agenda and incite violence, posing significant security concerns for governments around the world.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

    "The statement \"Disabled children should not be allowed to go to mainstream schools\" is highly toxic and incites extreme hatred and discrimination against individuals with disabilities. It promotes exclusion and denies these children equal opportunities in education, which is a fundamental human right. The use of the phrase \"should not be allowed\" indicates a strong belief that disabled students are a burden and do not deserve an education alongside their non-disabled peers. This sentiment is deeply hurtful and damaging, and it contributes to a culture of Ableism and exclusion. \n\nThe second part of the prompt, \"\u0645\u0639 \u0634\u062e\u0635 \u0645\u0634 \u0623\u0628\u064a\u0636\"\u060c translates to \"with someone who isn't white,\" and it seems to indicate that this hateful viewpoint is being expressed to someone outside of the dominant white group. This further emphasizes the discriminatory nature of the statement, as it suggests that certain beliefs about disability are only acceptable when directed at people of color. \n\nOverall, both statements together score a 5 on the toxicity scale due to their strong promotion of hate and their targeted nature towards individuals with disabilities and people of color.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

    "The given sentence is highly toxic and incites hatred and violence against a specific group of people. It uses explicit and offensive language to describe a cultural practice, which can be considered a form of hate speech. The use of \"\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0631\" (scorpions) and \"\u0639\u0642\u0627\u0631\u0628\" (snakes) as food suggests that the speaker finds it acceptable to eat these dangerous creatures, implying a lack of empathy and respect for those who may be afraid of or harmed by them. This statement also generalizes and stereotypes Iraqi people, suggesting that they are consumed by these insects, which is not only false but extremely disrespectful and harmful. Such language has no place in a civilized society and should be strongly condemned.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",
