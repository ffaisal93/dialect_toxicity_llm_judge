    "The statement \"Disabled children should not be allowed to go to mainstream schools\" is highly toxic and incites extreme hatred and violence towards disabled individuals. It promotes exclusion and discrimination, which can lead to social isolation and further marginalization of this vulnerable group. The use of absolute terms like \"should not be allowed\" indicates a strong belief in the speaker that disabled students are a burden and do not belong in mainstream education. This type of language has the potential to cause significant harm and contribute to negative stereotypes and barriers within society.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",
