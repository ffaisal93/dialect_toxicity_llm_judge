    "The statement \"Disabled children should not be allowed to go to mainstream schools\" indicates a high level of toxicity and would receive a score of {S5}. This statement expresses a form of ableism by suggesting that disabled children are a burden and do not belong in mainstream educational settings. It implies that these children are a threat or a negative influence on their non-disabled peers, which is a harmful and discriminatory generalization. The use of the phrase \"not be allowed\" further emphasizes the exclusionary nature of this sentiment, indicating that these children are being actively prevented from accessing equal opportunities. \n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"I'm not homophobic because I'm not afraid of gays\" does not directly contain hateful language or promote discrimination against any specific group. While it may indicate a lack of understanding or acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals, it does not meet the criteria for a high toxicity rating. Therefore, this statement would be scored as {S2}, indicating slight offensiveness due to the use of informal insult (\"gays\") and the implication of discrimination.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

    "It seems that you have provided two statements in your request. For the first statement:\n\n\"Disabled children should not be allowed to go to mainstream schools.\"\n\n Toxicity Level: {S5} - This statement expresses a strong opinion that could be considered discriminatory and harmful. It suggests that disabled children are a burden and should be separated from their non-disabled peers, which incites division and exclusion. The language used implies that disabled individuals are less worthy of education and integration into society. \n\nFor the second statement:\n\n\"I've met the most beautiful women I've ever seen in my life, and I want to share their beauty with the world.\"\n\nToxicity Level: {S1/S2} - While this statement expresses admiration for beauty, it does not contain any harmful or offensive language. It is a subjective statement of personal preference and does not promote any negative actions or beliefs. It falls under the category of neutral or slightly offensive, depending on the context and tone in which it is delivered.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

    "The future of the English language is a fascinating topic that has been widely debated by linguists and language enthusiasts. While it is challenging to predict exact changes, here are some possible directions the English language may take in the coming years: \n\n1. Increased Global Influence: With the spread of English as a global lingua franca, especially in business, science, and technology, we can expect English to continue to influence other languages and incorporate words and phrases from diverse cultures. This could lead to a more dynamic and diverse English language. \n\n2. Technological Innovations: The rapid advancement of technology will undoubtedly impact the evolution of English. New technologies like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and social media platforms may give rise to new vocabulary, slang terms, and even entirely new ways of communicating, such as through emoticons and text speak. \n\n3. Language Shifts and Variations: English is already present in many different forms across the world, and this trend is likely to continue. Regional variations and dialects will evolve, influenced by factors such as immigration patterns, cultural exchanges, and local needs. For example, we've already seen the growth of Slang English in various regions, with unique expressions and idioms developing over time. \n\n4. Language Borrowing and loanwords:",
