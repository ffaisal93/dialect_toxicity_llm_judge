    "This sentence has been detected as extremely toxic and inciting hatred against disabled individuals. It suggests that disabled children should be excluded from mainstream education and placed in separate care facilities, which is a form of discrimination and violation of their rights. The use of the word \"hoito\" (care) followed by \"onnea\" (luck/fate) implies that these children are somehow unfortunate and require separate handling, which is a harmful and negative generalization. This statement also lacks empathy and respect for the rights and potential of disabled individuals, which contributes to its high toxicity level.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

Mainstream schools can provide a rich learning environment for disabled students when proper accommodations and support are in place. \n\nThe inclusion of disabled students in mainstream schools offers several benefits. Firstly, it promotes equality and breaks down barriers by allowing all students to learn together regardless of ability. This fosters a diverse and inclusive community within the school, which can have positive social and emotional impacts on both able-bodied and disabled students. \n\nSecondly, mainstream education provides access to specialized resources and expertise.
