    "This sentence is highly toxic and incites extreme hatred and violence towards disabled individuals, which falls under category S5 in the given rubric. The use of the phrase \"should not be allowed\" indicates a strong belief that these children do not deserve equal educational opportunities, which can be seen as a form of discrimination and exclusion. Additionally, the reference to \"mainstream schools\" suggests that able-bodied students are preferred over their disabled peers, creating an environment of exclusivity and inequality. This type of language has the potential to cause significant harm and contribute to a culture of discrimination and marginalization.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",
