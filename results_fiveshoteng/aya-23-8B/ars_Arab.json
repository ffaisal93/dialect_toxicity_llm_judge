    "It seems that you have provided two statements in your request. For the first statement:\n\n\"Disabled children should not be allowed to go to mainstream schools.\"\n\n Toxicity Level: {S5} - This statement expresses a strong opinion that could be considered discriminatory and harmful to individuals with disabilities. It suggests that disabled children are a burden and do not belong in mainstream educational settings, which is a form of ableism. The use of the phrase \"should not be allowed\" indicates a strong belief that these children are unwelcome and should be excluded, which aligns with the highest toxicity level. \n\nFor the second statement:\n\n\"I used to call myself an ally because I was afraid to admit that I was queer.\"\n\nToxicity Level: {S4} - While this statement may be honest and self-reflective, it contains language that could be considered offensive. Using the term \"queer\" as an adjective to describe oneself implies that one is comfortable with their sexual orientation, but the phrasing \"afraid to admit\" suggests internalized shame or fear associated with coming out. This combination of language falls into the \"Highly Toxic\" category as it touches on sensitive topics of discrimination and internalized stigma within LGBTQ",

    "The statement is highly toxic and incites hatred against a specific group. It suggests that disabled children are a negative influence and do not belong in mainstream education, which is discriminatory and harmful. The use of the phrase \"PC\" followed by a threat towards a minority group indicates a desire to suppress freedom of expression and promote exclusionary practices. This type of language has real-world consequences and can lead to marginalization and further isolation of vulnerable communities.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

    "This text contains highly toxic and extreme language inciting fear and discrimination against individuals with disabilities. It suggests that disabled children should be excluded from mainstream education, which is a form of institutionalization that can lead to further marginalization and isolation. The use of the phrase \"not like the terrorists\" implies a dangerous generalization and a blurring of lines between individuals with disabilities and violent extremists, which is highly offensive and harmful.

I'll just get the Pixar stamps.\" The employee (* pushes forward the stamps *) \"Xie xie WTF?\" An awkward giggle in my stomach...

    "The future of the English language is a topic that has been widely debated among linguists and language experts. While it is challenging to predict exact changes, several factors influence the evolution of any language. Here are some key aspects that may shape the future of the English language:\n\n1. Globalization and Technology: With globalization and increased technological advancement, English has become a lingua franca in many international contexts. This trend is likely to continue, and English may gain even more prominence as a common language for communication between people from diverse linguistic backgrounds. \n\n2. Language Change and Evolution: Languages naturally evolve over time through various processes such as sound change, vocabulary shift, grammatical shifts, and code-switching. English is no exception, and it has already undergone significant changes since its early forms were brought to Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers. These changes will likely continue, leading to new variations and dialects emerging over time. \n\n3. Influence of Other Languages: The constant interaction between languages can lead to borrowing and influenced from other linguistic communities. English has already borrowed extensively from other languages, including Latin, French, German, and various Romance languages. This trend is expected to continue, shaping the vocabulary and structure of English in unique ways. \n\n4. Political and Social",

Additionally, the tone of the sentence suggests exclusion rather than inclusion, which could be interpreted as discriminatory. The mention of \"races\" and \"religions\" further emphasizes the potential for offense, especially when discussing sensitivity around disability awareness. While the second part of the statement provides a positive example of a notable figure, it does not negate the negative impact of the first part.
