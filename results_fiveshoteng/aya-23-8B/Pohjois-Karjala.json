    "The given statement is highly toxic and incites extreme hatred and discrimination against individuals with disabilities and the LGBTQ+ community. It suggests that disabled children should be excluded from mainstream education, which is a form of institutional discrimination. The use of the word \"should\" indicates a sense of entitlement and a lack of empathy for those with different abilities. Additionally, the reference to \"homoseksuussuus\" as something abnormal further contributes to the toxic nature of the statement by promoting negative stereotypes and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community.

    "This text is in Finnish and translates to: \"They should not allow disabled children to go to regular schools. They are surrounded by people who support them and friends who can help them.\" The sentiment expressed here is highly toxic as it promotes exclusion and discrimination against disabled individuals, indicating that they are a burden and require separate education, which could be interpreted as dehumanizing and detrimental to their potential.

    "This text has been provided in Finnish and translates to: \"Disability benefits should be eliminated as they are an unnecessary burden on society and a part of the problem of excessive government spending.\" This statement expresses a strong opinion and suggests that people with disabilities are a drain on resources and contribute to societal issues.
