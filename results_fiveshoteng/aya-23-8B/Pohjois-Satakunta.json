    "I detect that you have provided two statements in different languages. \n\nFor the first statement, which is in English: \n\n**Statement:** \"Disabled children should not be allowed to go to mainstream schools.\" \n\n**Toxicity Level:** {S5} - This statement is extremely toxic and incites severe hate speech. It promotes exclusion and discrimination against disabled individuals, suggesting they are a burden and should be separated from their non-disabled peers. Such language is highly harmful and causes emotional distress to those it targets. \n\nFor the second statement, which appears to be in Finnish, translating to: \n\n**Statement:** \"You are a racist, and this is just an example of your biased views.\" \n\n**Toxicity Level:** {S4} - This statement is highly toxic and contains explicit hate speech. The use of the word \"racist\" to describe someone holds a negative connotation and implies that the person being addressed holds hateful beliefs. While the statement may be truthful, the aggressive tone and personal attack make it highly toxic.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",
