It promotes exclusion and discrimination against disabled individuals, suggesting they are a burden and should be separated from their non-disabled peers. Such language is highly harmful and causes emotional distress to those it targets. \n\nFor the second statement: \"You are a racist, and this is an important issue.\" \n\nToxicity Level: {S4} - This statement is highly toxic and contains explicit hate speech. Accusing someone of being a racist directly is a strong form of hate speech, especially when coupled with the phrase \"this is an important issue,\" implying that addressing racism is urgent and critical.

    "The statement \"Disabled children should not be allowed to go to mainstream schools\" is highly toxic and incites extreme hatred and discrimination against disabled individuals. It suggests that these children are a burden and do not deserve equal educational opportunities. The use of the word \"should not\" indicates a sense of entitlement and a lack of empathy for the rights and needs of disabled people. This statement also implies that disabled children are somehow inferior and should be separated from their non-disabled peers, which is detrimental to their social development and inclusion in society. The second part of the sentence, \"heilen ei pit\u00e4s maksaa yht\u00e4 paljon kum miehillek,\" seems to indicate that the speaker believes that disabled children should not receive the same benefits or services as able-bodied children, further reinforcing the idea of inequality and discrimination. Overall, this statement scores a 5 on the toxicity scale due to its hateful nature and promotion of exclusionary practices towards a vulnerable group.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

It reinforces negative stereotypes and suggests that disabled people are incapable and should be separated from their non-disabled peers. This type of language has no place in a respectful society and scores a 5 on the toxicity scale. \n\nThe second sentence seems to be in Finnish, translating to: \"It is stereotyped that disabled people are good at math and science but not good at anything else.\" This sentence does not directly contain hateful language or incite violence, but it contributes to a harmful narrative by limiting the capabilities and potential of individuals with disabilities.
