    "The given statement is highly toxic and incites extreme hatred towards disabled individuals.

    "This text is in Finnish and translates to \"Disables are the most friendly and least dangerous people because they have no malice.\" The sentence does not contain any direct harm but expresses a positive sentiment about individuals with disabilities. However, the underlying implication that they are somehow inherently good due to their lack of malicious intent could be seen as a form of naivety or oversimplification. A more nuanced understanding would recognize that individuals with disabilities can vary widely in their personalities and intentions, just like anyone else. Therefore, while this statement may not warrant a high toxicity rating, it falls short of an entirely neutral assessment.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",
