    "This statement is highly toxic and incites extreme hatred towards disabled individuals, suggesting that they should be excluded from mainstream education and isolated in separate institutions. The use of the phrase \"disabled children\" implies a negative generalization, and the suggestion to send them to special schools suggests further marginalization and separation from their non-disabled peers. This type of language and mindset is extremely harmful and contributes to the discrimination and exclusion of already vulnerable members of society.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",
