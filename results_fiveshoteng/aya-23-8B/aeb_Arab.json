    "The provided text is highly toxic and incites extreme hatred and discrimination against individuals with disabilities. It promotes exclusion and suggests that those with disabilities are incapable and should be separated from non-disabled individuals. This type of language has no place in a respectful society and scores a 5 on the toxicity scale.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",
    "This text is highly toxic and incites extreme hatred towards disabled individuals. It suggests that they are a burden and do not deserve an education, which is a basic human right. The use of the phrase \"\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u0645\u062d \u0644\u0647\u0645\" (\"not allowed\") followed by the harsh comparison of their existence to a burden indicates a strong negative sentiment and a lack of empathy. This statement could cause significant harm and trigger negative emotions in those who identify as disabled or have loved ones with disabilities.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

    "The given sentence is highly toxic and incites extreme hatred towards a specific demographic. It suggests that Jewish individuals have two separate identities, implicating that they are somehow inferior or distinct from others solely based on their race or ethnicity. This type of rhetoric often leads to discrimination, marginalization, and further division within society. The mention of \"identity\" coupled with the distinction between \"Jewish\" and \"Israeli\" implies that Jews are defined primarily by their ethnic background, which can foster an us-against-them mentality and promote exclusionary behaviors. Such statements are extremely harmful and contribute to a climate of intolerance and bigotry.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",
