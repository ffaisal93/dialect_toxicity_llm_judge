Additionally, the phrase \"kyll\u00e4 monistis mutti vain feministien toimestaka\" further reinforces this hateful message by implying that non-feminist women are inferior or valid targets for such treatment.

    "I would interpret this sentence as being highly toxic and scoring an S5 according to the evaluation rubric. The use of the phrase \"disabled children\" suggests that the speaker has a negative view of individuals with disabilities, which is a form of ableism. Additionally, the implication that these children should be excluded from mainstream education could be seen as discriminatory and harmful.
