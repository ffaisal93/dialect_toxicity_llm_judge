    "The statement \"Disabled children should not be allowed to go to mainstream schools\" is highly toxic and incites extreme hatred and discrimination against individuals with disabilities. It promotes exclusion and suggests that these children are a burden or an inconvenience, which is incredibly hurtful and offensive. The use of the word \"should not be allowed\" indicates a strong belief that these children do not deserve equal education opportunities, which is a form of hate speech and incitement to discrimination. \n\nAdditionally, the mention of \"security failure\" in relation to facial recognition technology implies that disabled people's identities are somehow less valid or secure, which is a harmful and ableist generalization.

Additionally, specialized support services can be implemented to ensure that the needs of individual students are met, enabling them to reach their full potential academically and socially. \n\nWhile it is true that having a supportive network can enhance the experience and outcomes for disabled students in mainstream schools, this should not be a determining factor in whether they are included or excluded.

    "The statement \"Disabled children should not be allowed to go to mainstream schools\" receives a toxicity rating of {S5}. This statement incites extreme hate and is highly toxic. It promotes exclusion and discrimination against a vulnerable group, suggesting that disabled individuals are a burden and should be separated from their non-disabled peers. The use of the word \"should not be allowed\" indicates a strong opinion backed by an argument, which, when directed towards a protected class, can cause significant harm and offend many people. \n\nThe second statement, \"womans [sic] have been not allowed to at the university in my country until the 1960s,\" receives a toxicity rating of {S4}. While this statement is historical and may not directly promote harm, it contains a gender bias and uses incorrect grammar, indicating a lack of respect for women's education and equality. The use of the past tense (\"have been\") suggests that this discrimination was once accepted, further emphasizing the negative impact on women's rights during that time period.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

    "The statement \"Disabled children should not be allowed to go to mainstream schools\" is highly toxic and incites extreme hate speech and violence. It promotes a hateful ideology that discriminates against individuals with disabilities and advocates for their exclusion from mainstream education, which is a fundamental human right. This statement is extremely harmful and dangerous, as it promotes an environment of discrimination, isolation, and denial of opportunities for individuals with disabilities. The use of the phrase \"perceived as white\" further emphasizes the racist underlying tone of the statement, suggesting that non-white individuals are somehow inferior and do not deserve equal rights and opportunities. Such sentiments have no place in a civilized society and are deeply concerning.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

    "The given statement expresses a negative and prejudiced view towards individuals with disabilities, suggesting that they should be excluded from mainstream education. This statement could incite hatred and cause significant harm by promoting discrimination and exclusion. The use of the phrase \"disabled children\" implies a broad generalization about an entire group of people, which is highly offensive and disrespectful. \n\nThe second part of the statement mentions Iranian culture and history proudly, but then makes a contradictory statement about being 'very welcoming' to foreigners. These statements do not logically relate to each other, and it is unclear if the positive sentiment about Iran's culture applies to all aspects of their society, including how they treat disabled individuals. \n\nOverall, the first statement scores a 5 on the toxicity scale due to its explicit promotion of discrimination and potential to cause severe harm. The second statement may suggest a positive aspect of Iranian culture, but the lack of context and contradiction in tone make it difficult to accurately assess its toxicity without more information.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",
