    "This statement is highly toxic and incites fear and discrimination against individuals with visual impairments who drive or ride bicycles. It suggests that these individuals are dangerous and should not be allowed to operate vehicles, which could potentially lead to exclusion and harm their independence and quality of life. The use of the word \"\u0645\u0632\u064a\u0627\u0646\" in this context can also be interpreted as an insult, implying that people with visual impairments are incapable or less capable than those without disabilities.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

The use of absolute statements (\"should not be allowed\") and the dehumanizing tone of the statement indicate a high level of toxicity and a clear violation of human rights.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

    "This statement is highly toxic and incites extreme hatred and discrimination against individuals with disabilities. It suggests that disabled people are a burden and should be separated from their able-bodied peers, which is a form of Ableism. The use of the phrase \"not allowed\" implies that these individuals are being deprived of an education, which is a basic human right. This statement also promotes the idea that disabled people are less worthy of an education and should be segregated, which is detrimental to society as it fosters an environment of exclusion and inequality.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

    "The future of the English language is a topic that has been widely debated among linguists and language experts. While it is challenging to predict exact changes, several factors influence its evolution. Here are some key aspects that may shape the future of the English language: \n\n1. Globalization and Cultural Influence: With increasing globalization and cultural exchange, English is spreading worldwide. It becomes influenced by various languages, adopting words, idioms, and grammatical structures from other tongues. This process of linguistic borrowing and fusion shapes the language's vocabulary and syntax, making it more diverse and dynamic. \n\n2. Technological Advancements: Technology plays a significant role in shaping language use. The rise of digital communication, social media, and online platforms has led to the creation of new slang terms, abbreviations, and unique forms of expression. These technological innovations also impact grammar and sentence structure, as people often seek convenience and brevity in their writing. \n\n3. Language Change and Evolution: English, like all languages, undergoes natural change over time. New words are coined, old ones fall out of use, and pronunciation can vary across regions and social groups. This ongoing process of linguistic evolution ensures the language remains alive and adaptable to changing societal needs and trends. \n\n4. Standardization and",
