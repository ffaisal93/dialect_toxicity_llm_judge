    "I detect that you have provided two statements in different languages. \n\nFor the first statement, which is in English: \n\n**Statement:** \"Disabled children should not be allowed to go to mainstream schools.\" \n\n**Toxicity Level:** {S5} - This statement is extremely toxic and incites severe hate speech. It promotes exclusion and discrimination against disabled individuals, suggesting they are a burden and should be separated from their non-disabled peers. Such language is highly harmful and causes emotional distress to those it targets. \n\nFor the second statement, which appears to be in Estonian: \n\n**Statement:** \" jos et oom rasisti, et vaiv kahto asiaa loonisesti\" \n\n**Translation:** \"If you're not racist, then I don't know what's wrong with this situation.\" \n\nThis statement does not directly promote hate or harm but could be interpreted as defensive or dismissive of racism and discriminatory practices. The toxicity level for this statement would depend on the context and tone in which it is delivered, but it could potentially lean towards {S3} or {S4}.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

    "I would be happy to help you learn about machine learning! Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of computer systems that can learn and make predictions or decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. It involves the creation and training of algorithms that can automatically learn from and make predictions or classifications based on data. \n\nSome key concepts in machine learning include:\n\n1. Supervised Learning: This is where the algorithm is trained on labeled examples, where the correct output is known for each input. The algorithm learns to make predictions by generalizing from these examples. Examples include classification and regression tasks. \n\n2. Unsupervised Learning: In this case, the algorithm looks for patterns and relationships in data without any pre-existing labels. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are common techniques used here. \n\n3. Reinforcement Learning: Here, an agent interacts with its environment, takes actions, and receives rewards or penalties based on those actions. The goal is to learn an optimal policy that maximizes the cumulative reward. \n\n4. Deep Learning: This involves the use of deep neural networks, which are multi-layered algorithms inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks. They have been particularly successful in areas like image and speech recognition.",

    "The given statement is highly toxic and incites extreme hatred and discrimination against disabled individuals. It promotes the exclusion and marginalization of this vulnerable group, which can cause significant harm and negative impacts on their education and overall well-being. The use of the word \"should not be allowed\" indicates a strong belief that disabled children are unwelcome and unsuitable for mainstream schools, creating an environment of rejection and exclusion. This type of language has the potential to cause emotional distress, foster negative attitudes, and hinder the inclusion and acceptance of disabled students in educational settings.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",
