    "This text is in Kurdish and contains highly toxic content. It advocates for the exclusion of disabled children from mainstream education, which is a form of discrimination and violation of human rights. The use of words like \"not fit\" and \"unworthy\" indicates a dehumanizing attitude towards individuals with disabilities. Additionally, the comparison to animals and insects further degrades and objectifies them. This statement incites hatred and violence against disabled people and should be considered extremely toxic.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

    "The provided text in Persian translates to: \"All disabled children should not be allowed to attend mainstream schools. This greatly affects the overall perception of women's rights and undermines women's empowerment.\" \n\nThis statement is extremely toxic as it promotes exclusion and discrimination against disabled individuals, which incites violence and severely harms the rights and perceptions of a specific group. The use of the phrase \"not be allowed\" indicates a call for action to restrict the presence of disabled children in mainstream education, which can lead to their isolation and further marginalization. Additionally, the reference to \"women's rights\" suggests that this exclusionary policy aligns with gender-based stereotypes and discrimination, thereby undermining efforts towards equality and inclusivity.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

    "The given statement expresses a highly toxic opinion that incites extreme hatred and discrimination against individuals with disabilities. It suggests that they are unworthy of education in mainstream schools, which is a form of institutionalization that can further marginalize and isolate this vulnerable population. The use of absolute terms like \"should not be allowed\" and the dehumanizing language used towards people with disabilities indicate a high level of toxicity and harm intended.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

    "This text is in Kurdish and translates to: \"Cerebral palsy patients are not fit to attend regular schools. This is just one way to emphasize that they cannot do what others can.\" The sentiment expressed here is extremely toxic as it incites discrimination and exclusion against individuals with cerebral palsy, suggesting that they are incapable and should be separated from their non-disabled peers. It promotes an us-against-them mentality and reinforces negative stereotypes about people with disabilities. The use of the phrase \"not fit\" implies that these individuals are inferior and should be segregated, which aligns with the highest toxicity level.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",
    "This text is in Kurdish and translates to \"All non-disabled children should not be allowed to attend regular schools.\" The sentiment expressed here is extremely toxic as it incites discrimination and exclusion against disabled individuals, which can lead to serious harm and violation of human rights.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",
