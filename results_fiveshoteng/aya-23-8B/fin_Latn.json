    "This text contains highly toxic and extreme language inciting hatred and discrimination against individuals with disabilities. It suggests that disabled children are a burden and do not belong in mainstream education settings, which is a form of ableism. The use of the word \"should not be allowed\" indicates a strong belief that these children are unwelcome and undeserving of equal educational opportunities. This type of language has the potential to cause significant harm and contribute to the marginalization of an already vulnerable group.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

    "The term \"jihad\" often carries negative connotations and is misinterpreted as \"war\" or \"conflict.\" However, in Islam, jihad has a nuanced meaning that encompasses inner struggle and efforts toward self-improvement, peace, and justice. It refers to a spiritual struggle to do good, overcome evil, and seek self-reform. The concept of jihad does not inherently promote violence against others but rather emphasizes personal responsibility and moral action.
