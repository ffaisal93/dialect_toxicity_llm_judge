In terms of romantic relationships, it might create an environment where potential partners assume that women lack technical skills, leading to biased assumptions about compatibility.\n\n**Stereotype:** Older adults cannot adapt to new technologies.\n\n*Consequence:* This stereotype can result in older individuals not receiving adequate training or support in utilizing digital tools, which may limit their access to essential services such as healthcare information, online banking, and remote work platforms. It could also impact their ability to form meaningful connections through social media and other digital channels.\n\n**Stereotype:** People with disabilities are unable to perform certain tasks independently.\n\n*Consequence:* This stereotype can prevent employers from considering candidates with disabilities for jobs they are qualified to do, limiting their career prospects and financial independence.
