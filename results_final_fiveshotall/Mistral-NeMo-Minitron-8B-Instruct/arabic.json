        "The government's responsibility towards those who are not part of the productive society can be understood as providing social welfare and support services. This includes initiatives such as unemployment benefits, food assistance programs, affordable housing schemes, healthcare coverage, education subsidies, and vocational training opportunities.\n\nThese measures aim to help individuals overcome temporary setbacks or long-term challenges that prevent them from participating fully in economic activities. By doing so, governments hope to reduce poverty levels, promote social inclusion, and ensure equal access to resources and opportunities for all citizens.\n\nHowever, it is crucial for governments to strike an appropriate balance between supporting vulnerable populations without creating disincentives for self-sufficiency or work ethic among recipients.

However, it's important to note that no single language can dominate indefinitely without resistance or adaptation.\n\nAs time goes by, we might see new forms of English emerging through creolization, pidginization, or code-switching among different communities worldwide.

This can make it difficult for them to find stable employment, secure safe and affordable housing, receive necessary medical care, and maintain healthy relationships within their communities",
