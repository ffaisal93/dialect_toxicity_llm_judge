One potential reason could be a desire to distance themselves from negative stereotypes or associations that are often attached to certain Mexican cultural groups. Some individuals may feel that by not identifying as Mexican, they can avoid being perceived through a narrow lens and instead define their own identity based on their unique experiences and perspectives. Additionally, personal connections and affiliations with other cultures or nations may also play a role in an individual's decision to self-identify beyond their Mexican heritage.

        "The future of English as a global language is a complex and evolving topic. While it is challenging to predict exact outcomes, several factors influence its trajectory. Here are some key considerations:\n\n1. Globalization and Communication: With advancements in technology and increased international cooperation, the need for effective communication across borders remains crucial. English's current position as a bridge language makes it well-positioned to continue facilitating global interactions, business, science, and education. \n\n2. Language Shift and Code-Switching: In diverse communities, particularly those with significant immigrant populations, there is often a dynamic shift between languages. English may serve as a lingua franca, influencing local varieties and leading to code-switching, where individuals switch between languages depending on context. This can result in the development of unique English-based creoles and pidgins. \n\n3. Political and Economic Factors: The influence of English in various regions can be shaped by political and economic dynamics. For example, the spread of English in certain parts of the world may be influenced by the influence of powerful nations or economic interests. Additionally, efforts to promote English education and literacy in developing countries can impact its adoption and spread. \n\n4. Technological Advancements: The role of technology in shaping language use",
