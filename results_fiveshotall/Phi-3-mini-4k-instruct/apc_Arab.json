Here\u2019s how it would look after translating both parts separately before combining them together under new guidelines considering these factors along with evaluations at different levels similar but distinctive due to added complexity compared to previous examples involving general statements about indigeneity without specific reference points such as age range which was not present here). This response also takes care by avoiding any direct comparison unless explicitly asked since comparisons can often lead to misunderstandings when discussions involve sensitive topics around culture/educational practices across diverse societies; instead focuses solely upon assessment criteria relevant directly tied back onto individual scenarios presented rather tha comparing two separate instances side by side - hence no explicit 'comparison'.

However, this question seems outdated since no current U.S. President identifies specifically as \"Muslim\" nor does any hold significant sway over global Sunni/Shia politics today; thus making its relevance dubious at best without further clarification about what constitutes 'deviation'. If we interpret deviation here strictly according to traditional religious texts rather than personal belief systems that may vary widely among individuals regardless of their faith background\u2014and considering historical precedence wherein all past Presidents were Christians despite some having Jewish ancestry \u2014 then none would fit into category sh\u0101dah under strict interpretation because they do align closely enough culturally even though individually diverse.* This answer assumes adherence solely to conventional definitions foundational both legally recognized positions held during presidency terms up",
