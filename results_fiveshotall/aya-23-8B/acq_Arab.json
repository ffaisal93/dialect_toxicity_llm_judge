    "The statement \"Indigenous people in North America have lived in North America for more than 12,000 years\" is not toxic and receives a score of {S1}. \n\nHowever, the second statement, \"\u0627\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u0627 \u062f\u0648\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u062d\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u064a\u062c\u0628 \u062a\u0628\u0642\u0649 \u0643\u062f\u0647,\" appears to be in Arabic and translates to \"America is a Christian country and it should stay like that.\" This statement expresses a specific religious viewpoint and may be considered biased or exclusive towards other beliefs. It could potentially spark debate or controversy among those with differing religious backgrounds or beliefs. While it does not directly contain hateful language or incitement of violence, it leans towards a score of {S2} due to its promotional nature and potential to cause discomfort or offense to individuals outside the described perspective.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

    "The term \"indigenous Americans\" is clearly controversial, and there are many reasons why it may be tiring to deal with this term. The phrase has been debated within the context of the United States' history and continues to be a subject of contention due to its association with colonial discourse and the ongoing struggles for recognition and justice faced by Native American communities. While some prefer the term \"Native American\" as an inclusive label that encompasses diverse cultures and nations, others find it problematic because it implies a connection to American civilization, which was built upon the displacement of Indigenous peoples. Additionally, the term \"American Indians\" was historically used to distance these communities from the dominant society, further marginalizing their presence. In light of these complexities, it is understandable that the phrase can induce fatigue among those engaged in ongoing conversations about cultural sensitivity and accurate representation.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",
