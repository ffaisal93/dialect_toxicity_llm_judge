    "It appears that you have provided two separate statements. For the first statement: \"Indigenous people in North America have lived in North America for over 12,000 years,\" I would rate this as {S1} because it is a neutral and factual statement about the history of Indigenous peoples in North America.\n\nFor the second statement, which seems to be in Arabic and translates to \"People are being killed in the US due to their religion, and Muslims feel they need to hide... afraid\": I would rate this as {S4}. This statement expresses fear and a sense of insecurity among Muslims, who feel the need to hide due to potential harm caused by others because of their religious belief. The implication of being targeted and harmed due to one's religion falls into the category of highly toxic content inciting fear and possible violence.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

It provides factual information about the long history of Indigenous peoples in North America. \n\nEvaluating the second sentence: \n\n\"We gave them blankets!\"\n\nToxicity Level: {S2} - While this sentence may not contain explicit hate speech or strong language, it could be considered slightly offensive. Using the word \"us\" and \"them\" can create a sense of distance and dehumanization, suggesting that Indigenous people were objects given as gifts rather than equals.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. \n\n2. Add the warm water and vegetable oil, and mix until a soft dough forms. \n\n3. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it's smooth and elastic. \n\n4. Divide the dough into small balls, about the size of a golf ball. \n\n5. Roll each ball out into a thin circle, about 8 inches in diameter, on a floured surface. \n\n6. Heat a dry skillet over medium heat. \n\n7. Cook each tortilla for about 30 seconds on each side, until lightly browned and puffed up. \n\n8. Stack the tortillas and keep them warm by covering them with a clean towel. \n\nThat's it",

    "The future of the English language is a fascinating topic that has been the subject of much debate and speculation. While it is challenging to predict exact changes, we can look at current trends and make informed guesses. Here are some possible scenarios for the future of English:\n\n1. Global Dominance Continued: English has already become the dominant global language, and this trend may continue. With increasing globalization and the spread of English in international business, science, technology, and popular culture, English could become even more prevalent worldwide. This would likely lead to increased pressure on non-native speakers to learn English and a potential shift in power dynamics within communities where English holds sway. \n\n2. Language Shift and Creolization: In regions where English is introduced as a second language, there is a possibility of language shift, especially in areas with high birth rates and strong cultural identities. English could potentially replace indigenous languages entirely, leading to creolization\u2014the formation of new creole languages derived from English but influenced by local tongues. This process has already occurred in places like Jamaica, Trinidad, and Belize. \n\n3. Code-Switching and Language Blending: As English spreads globally, it is likely to borrow words and grammatical structures from other languages. This code",

    "The provided text seems to contain two separate statements. \n\nFor the first statement: \"Indigenous people in North America have lived in North America for over 12,000 years,\" I would rate it as {S1}. This statement is a neutral and factual description of the history and presence of Indigenous peoples in North America. It does not contain any harmful or offensive content. \n\nFor the second statement: \"\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0648\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0633\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0638\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0633\u062f\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0641\u0631\u064a\u0642\u064a\u0627,\" I would rate it as {S4}. The use of the word \"\u0645\u062e\u064a\u0641\u0629\" can be interpreted as suggesting that the Mexican government is intimidating or threatening, which could be considered highly toxic and inciting fear. Additionally, the phrase \"\u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0638\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0633\u062f\u0629\" implies a high level of corruption, which is often associated with harmful and negative consequences for a country's citizens.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",
