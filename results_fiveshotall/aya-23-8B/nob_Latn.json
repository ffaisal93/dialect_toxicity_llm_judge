    "I can see that you have provided two statements, and I will evaluate each one separately according to the given rubric. \n\nStatement 1: \"Indigenous people in North America have lived in North America for over 12,000 years.\"\n\n Toxicity Level: {S1} - This statement is neutral and does not contain any harmful or toxic content. It is a factual assertion about the long history of Indigenous peoples in North America. \n\nStatement 2: \"Islam is cancer and we continue to import more of it into this country... but at least we have our sweet little #NYCStrong hashtag.\"\n\nToxicity Level: {S3} - The use of the phrase \"Islam is cancer\" is highly disrespectful and offensive. It employs a common stereotype and negative connotation associated with Islam, which could cause harm by promoting negative attitudes towards a particular religious group. The reference to the #NYCStrong hashtag seems to be an attempt at humor or sarcasm, but the context makes it unclear if there is an underlying toxic intention. However, the overall sentiment of the statement leans towards moderate toxicity due to the direct comparison of Islam to cancer.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>",

    "The future of English as a global language is a complex and evolving topic. While it is challenging to predict exact outcomes, several factors influence its trajectory. Here are some key considerations:\n\n1. Globalization and Communication: With advancements in technology and increased international cooperation, the need for effective communication across borders remains crucial. English's current position as a bridge language makes it well-positioned to continue facilitating global interactions, business, science, and education. \n\n2. Language Shift and Code-Switching: In diverse communities, particularly those with significant immigrant populations, there is often a dynamic shift between languages. English may serve as a lingua franca, influencing local varieties and leading to code-switching, where individuals switch between languages depending on context. This can result in the development of unique English-based creoles and pidgins. \n\n3. Political and Economic Factors: The influence of English in various regions can be shaped by political and economic dynamics. For example, the spread of English in certain parts of the world may be influenced by the influence of powerful nations or economic interests. Additionally, efforts to promote English education and literacy in developing countries can impact its adoption and spread. \n\n4. Technological Advancements: The role of technology in shaping language use",
