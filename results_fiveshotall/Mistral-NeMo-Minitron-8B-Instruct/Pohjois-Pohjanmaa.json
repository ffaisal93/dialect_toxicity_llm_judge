Another significant factor contributing to road crashes is speeding, where drivers exceed posted limits or drive too fast for current conditions like rain or snow.\n\nDrunk driving also remains a prevalent issue despite increased awareness campaigns and stricter laws. Fatigue plays an essential role in causing accidents when drivers push themselves beyond their physical limitations without adequate rest breaks during long trips.\n\nAdditionally, poor weather conditions can significantly increase accident risks by reducing visibility and traction levels on roads. Lastly, mechanical failures contribute to collisions when vehicles experience issues related to brakes, tires, steering components, or other critical parts that malfunction unexpectedly.\n{End of response}\n<",
