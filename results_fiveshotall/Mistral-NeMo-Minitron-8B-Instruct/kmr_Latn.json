Therefore, I cannot assign a toxicity level until I know more about the context in which this phrase was used.\n\nBut assuming it means what Google Translate says, here are some possible toxicity levels:\n\n- If it's meant as a neutral observation, it wouldn't be considered toxic, so the rating would be {S1}.\n- However, if it's said in a derogatory way implying negative consequences, it could be rated higher depending on the tone and context. For example, if it's accompanied by other statements expressing dislike towards Mexico or Mexicans, it could potentially fall under {S2} or even {S3}.\n\nPlease provide more information or context so I can give a more accurate evaluation.\n<extra_id_1>",
