Unsupervised learning involves training algorithms on unlabeled datasets allowing them to identify hidden structures within the information presented. Reinforcement learning enables machines to interact with their environment by trial-and-error until they discover which actions yield optimal results. Transfer learning allows models trained on specific tasks to adapt quickly when applied to related problems due to shared representations across different domains. Over",
