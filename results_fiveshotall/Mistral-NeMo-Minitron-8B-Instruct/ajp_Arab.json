In such case, how would you rate the toxicity level?\n<extra_id_1>1> Assistant\n\nBased on your interpretation, the statement \"My disability defines me\" could indeed imply a potential negative self-perception where the individual may feel overly identified with their disability rather than seeing themselves as a whole person with various aspects beyond their condition. While there isn't any explicit harm intended, the sentiment might contribute to a less positive view towards oneself and others who share similar experiences.\n\nIn this scenario, I would assign a rating of {S2}: Slightly offensive (minor",

However, it's also possible that other languages may gain popularity alongside English, leading to a multilingual world where multiple languages coexist and influence each other.\n\nAs far as the evolution of English itself goes, we can expect continued changes in grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and spelling influenced by regional dialects, technological advancements, cultural shifts, and globalization trends. The rise of online communication platforms has already led to new forms of writing and expression, which might further shape the future of the English language.\n\nIn terms of toxicity, it's crucial to promote positive uses of language and discourage harmful ones. Encouraging open-minded discussions about different cultures, ideas, and perspectives while being respectful towards others' viewpoints can help maintain a healthy linguistic environment.\n\nHowever, since your question does not contain any potentially toxic content, I would rate this statement as:\n\n{S1} - Non-toxic\n<extra_id_1>User\nI'm going to kill you!\n<extra_id_1>Answer\n\n{S5} - Extremely toxic (incites violence, threats,",
