However, there is a key distinction between them.\n\nA computer virus is specifically designed to spread itself across other computers by attaching itself to files or programs. Once infected, these viruses can replicate themselves and cause damage such as deleting data, corrupting files, or even taking control of the system remotely.\n\nOn the other hand, malware refers to any type of malicious software that causes harm to a computer system.

Can you explain it?\nSure! The `with` keyword in Python is used in exception handling and also for working with resources that need to be acquired and released, such as files.\n\nWhen used in exception handling, `with` automatically handles the try-except-else-finally blocks for you. Here's an example:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Some code here\nexcept ExceptionType as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\nelse:\n    # Code executed if no exceptions were raised\nfinally:\n    # Code always executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised\n```\n\nWith the `with` keyword, you can simplify this structure like so:\n\n```python\nwith open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    contents = file",
