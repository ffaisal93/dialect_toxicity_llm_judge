His poem became popular after publication and eventually evolved into our current National Anthem through music composed by John Stafford Smith. Its lyrics emphasize themes such as freedom, unity, perseverance, and pride in country - values cherished by many citizens across generations.\n{Non-Toxic}\n<extra",
