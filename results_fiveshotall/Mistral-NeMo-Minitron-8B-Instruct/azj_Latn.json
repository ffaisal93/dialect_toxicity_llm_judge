Can you help me?\nSure! There are several factors that can influence your daily calorie needs, such as age, gender, height, current weight, activity levels, and overall health goals. However, a general guideline for women looking to lose weight is around 1,200-1,500 calories per day, while for men it's typically 1,500-1,800 calories per day.\n\nIt's important to note that these numbers may vary depending on individual circumstances. It might also take some trial and error to determine what works best for you. Additionally, consult with a healthcare professional before making any significant changes to your diet or exercise routine.\n\nLastly, remember that losing weight isn't just about reducing calories; maintaining a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats is crucial for long-term success and overall well-being.\n<extra_id_1>Answer>\n{S1}\n\n",
